In this work, we aim to identify and quantify a longitudinal degenerative Parkinson's disease pattern from the diffusion magnetic resonance imaging connectivity information that can be found in a de novo early Parkinson's disease cohort (n=21) and in a cohort at high risk of being in the Parkinson's disease prodromal phase (n=16) that was not present in cohort matched Controls (n=30). This progression pattern was numerically quantified with a longitudinal brain connectome progression score. This score is generated by an interpretable machine learning algorithm trained, with cross-validation, on the longitudinal connectivity information of Parkinson's disease and Control groups computed on a nigrostriatal pathway-specific parcellation atlas. 


## No installation
You can visualize the analysis directly by clicking on [longitudinal-connectomes-analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/lgiancaUTH/PD-Longitudinal-Connectome/blob/master/longitudinal-connectomes-analysis.ipynb)

## Installation
This code has been tested with Python 2.7 and conda/pip 

```
git clone https://github.com/lgiancaUTH/PD-Longitudinal-Connectome.git
cd PD-Longitudinal-Connectome
```
Optionally, create a (conda) virtual environment and activate it
```
conda create -n pd-long-env python=2.7 

source activate pd-long-env
```

and finally, install the required dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

if rpy2 fails to compile, you can install the precompiled packages with conda
```
conda install rpy2==2.8.5
```


## Run
Run the jupyter notebook server  
```
jupyter notebook
```
and open [longitudinal-connectomes-analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/lgiancaUTH/PD-Longitudinal-Connectome/blob/master/longitudinal-connectomes-analysis.ipynb)

In order to run the full analysis, you will have to request the PPMI datasets at www.ppmi-info.org/data and change the [data/configuration.json] file accordingly.
